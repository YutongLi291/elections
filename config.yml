      Hi everyone! As a VP Communications executive, my plan is to make it easy
      for both passerby and fanatic Smash players to know what's happening at
      the Cube.

      I'm a 3rd year CS student from Hawai'i. Some of you may have seen me at
      the Cube, and I sometimes bring my Nintendo Switch for everyone to use.

      Here's some things I've done in the past:

      - ðŸšŒ Ran a [promotional campaign](https://imgur.com/fDSgZRT) for a Hawai'i bus app
      - ðŸŽ¬ Put together [GIFs to demo projects](https://github.com/NotWoods/unity-polygon-2d-editor)
      - ðŸŽ„ Stayed up late during holidays making [animated christmas e-cards](https://github.com/omlhawaii/christmas-cards/tree/master/2016) for my family's business

      Hello lovely CS students! My name is Natalie Chen, and I'll be running for
      Vice-President Internal here at CSSS. I am a third year Computer Science
      student (like many of you!) and would love to have your vote for the
      upcoming elections. For the past few years the CSSS has become like a big
      family to me, especially frequents at the Cube--my home away from home. In
      the future, I would like to help the CSSS continue giving others to have a
      place to feel welcome on campus. I will bring in my experiences and ideas
      from Red Cross and numerous customer service related work places to
      further better the Cube. Should you have any questions please feel free to
      contact me!

      My email is: <nataliechen1024@alumni.ubc.ca>

      Hi, I'm Emmanuel, but some of you might know me as Em. I was introduced to
      the CSSS when I started to hang out in the Cube as a first year looking
      for a place to belong. I can happily say that in the CSSS I found a
      community that I can call family and a place that I can call home! My
      greatest joy has been to extend this welcoming spirit to the UBC CS
      community at large - as an officer last year and as VP Finance this year,
      I hope I've been able to make a positive difference for your experience on
      campus, whether it was by helping organize an event or by welcoming you to
      the Cube.

      As President, my primary goal would be to make *every* CS student feel
      like they have a community they can call their own. That means introducing
      new initiatives and events so that the CSSS will be able to better foster
      your interests, and taking more input from your suggestions from all of
      our platforms. From project showcases to technical talks and workshops to
      free coffee weeks to expanding our board game collection, it should be the
      club's mission to continually find new ways to improve its ability to
      serve the community.

      I would be honoured to have your trust to lead this effort. With the
      experience I've garnered over the years, I believe that I will be able to
      make this happen for you.

      Thank you very much!

      My name is Ethan Yeung, and I am running for the position of VP Admin. If
      you want a flunky to take notes or fetch coffee for you, thatâ€™d be me.
      With regards to the formal responsibilities of the VP admin position, I
      have previous experience with taking transcripts and minutes, engaging
      with academic administration, and acting as a student-admin go-between. As
      for to my motivation, I just want a room key for the Cube so I can avoid
      having to leave. I spend most of my free time there, and I can be found
      reliably if, for some reason, you need something from me.

      Hello fellow Computer Science students!

      My name is Michael Chern, a 3rd-year computer science student. I will be
      running for Vice-President: Administration of the CSSS. Iâ€™ve had previous
      experience managing and organizing as president of my high-school social
      club and I believe I can use my skills to contribute and build the CSSS
      such that it benefits you; the students more than it does now.

      If elected as Vice President: Administration, I will:

      - Motivate and organize executive meetings to ensure maximum efficiency

      - Organize meetings in a way such that all important topics are covered

      - Ensure everyone within the organization has an equal voice

      - Streamline efficiency of the exec group as a whole so that the CSSS can
        function at its best

      Hello!

      My name is Chanbin, a first-year hoping to major in Computer Science.

      I currently hold a position at the CSSS as an Internal Officer, and have
      gained an interest in community involvement and participation throughout
      the time I have been involved here.

      As a Vice President Volunteering, I hope to encourage more people into
      becoming a part of the team, allow others to get more involved in
      community activities, and to help everyone have a great year! :)

      #### Hello fellow computers!

      My name is Jonathan Budiardjo. Some might know me as the CPSC121 Head TA,
      the guy always at the Cube, or as the current Vice President Internal
      (VPI) of the CSSS. I hope to use the leadership and organizational skills
      that Iâ€™ve gained from my prior experiences to move CSSS forward.

      From my term working as VPI of CSSS, I have gained the opportunity to
      understand and work closely with its inner structure, and also been able
      to familiarize myself with presidential duties and daily club operations.

      If I am elected to be the President of the CSSS, I will:

      - Maintain the transparency of CSSS activities
      - Incorporate more community suggestions and feedback
      - Increase in outgoing communication by actively communicating through social media
      - Be a dependable friend and leader

      The CSSS has become a large part of my daily routine and undergraduate
      experience and I have enjoyed being part of the community to the point
      where it is like a second home for me. I hope to use this opportunity to
      give back by providing a memorable experience to other students.

      Just in case my name is too large for the form - it's Jack Spalding-Jamieson.

      I've worked under the 2017-2018 VP Internal as an officer for this last
      year and have learned the duties of this role thoroughly. The VP Internal
      primarily works on the operations inside the lounge. I have some particular
      hopes for this next year:

      - Right now we stock the cube with a variety of items including soft drinks, bottled water, instant ramen, lasanga, pizza pops, and candy bars (and we sell with often pennies of overhead). These are quite popular, so they will probably stay, although I hope to add some new items too - some possibilities are milk & cereal and bread & jam, but I will open a survey.
      - I am familiar with (and hope to automate) the locker rentals.
      - I know how to acquire new printer cartridges.
      - This year we replaced two couches (one with a standing desk), a microwave, and the credit card tablet. I hope we don't have to replace large items again but I will make sure it happens promptly if we do.
      - A new smash bros has been announced for this year. Given the number of people this attracts to the lounge alone this is certainly a priority if it releases on time.
      - I'm also hoping we can organize some coordinated events with the SFU CSSS - regardless of the rivalry, they are a fun group of people. Maybe we could sign a peace treaty if things go well.

      That guy you see doing physics in the comp sci clubroom ~~because combined majors make sense~~.

      *Not this term though because I'm away on co-op.*

      I've been with the CSSS since the start of my first year, and have served as an internal officer for the majority of the time since.
      I intend to take on a greater role serving the Cube next year, by maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Cube in the position of VPF.
      I have a full year's worth of experience as treasurer for another club under the AMS, and I even have my own duct tape to hold everything together!

      Hi there! I'm William, a first-year, going on second-year student who
      loves CS!

      I've organized hackathons and other events in the past, so I'm no stranger
      to event organization and coordination.

      This year I functioned as one of the two CSSS first year representatives,
      where I reached out to other first year students with the aim of
      connecting them to each other and creating a community within CS. Notably,
      I organized the first ever CSSS escape room event which turned out to be a
      widely enjoyed event.

      As your social officer I would strive to continue to put my skills of
      outreach, event organization, and community building to good use. You can
      expect to run into more exciting, new events like the escape room if you
      vote for me as your social officer!
