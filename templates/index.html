<h1 class="page-header">CSSS Elections</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Computer Science Student Society's online election system.</p>

<p>To vote you will need to be a Computer Science student, or be intending to go
  into Computer Science and have taken CPSC 110 and CPSC 121 in the past year.

<p>If you don't have a CS account, you can get one from <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/getacct/">getacct</a>.
  If you run into issues logging in, please try running <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/getacct/">getacct</a> or using a
  desktop
  browser. Links opened in the Messenger web view are known to break login.
</p>

<p>CS login is only used to ensure only one vote per person. The CSSS at no
  point has access to your password since the CS department servers
  <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/core.html#cgipassauth">strip all
    authentication details</a> before running our application.
